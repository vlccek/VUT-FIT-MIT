# Project Highlights

This project focuses on amino acid co-evolution, using Mutual Information (MI) to identify pairs of positions that likely mutated together throughout evolution. A key feature is the advanced and fully automated PyMOL visualization, which not only fetches the 3D structure from an online database but also intelligently highlights the top 10 pairs. Residue colors are mapped to a yellow-to-red gradient based on the strength of their most significant interaction. Additionally, residues involved in multiple significant pairs are specially marked with a different backbone color for easy identification. The final, high-quality image includes labels with the precise MI value and distance in Ångströms, providing an instant visual validation of the statistical predictions.
